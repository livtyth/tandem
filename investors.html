    <h2>Management Information</h2>
    <p>Your ability to direct the companies in which you invest depends on the management information you receive, but this is only as good as the systems and processes they rely on.
    We set up business management systems appropriate to the size and complexity of the business, such as Accounting, Cashflow forecasting, and CRM systems. We work with your team to design (simple) processes to ensure these systems are kept up to date, for example: budgeting, expenses procedure, purchase orders, and essential record keeping.</p>

    <h2>Predictable Project Management</h2>
    <p>Entrepreneurs have limitless ambition, but at times this comes with a lack of focus which - as the company grows - can cause the business to stall. We believe that startups need freedom to be creative, and we donâ€™t want to impose a stifling corporate structure around them, but we also know that taking a structured approach to project management can deliver the best of both worlds.
    Agreeing the strategy, building a product roadmap, and taking a sprint led approach enable teams to deliver more, and recognise the speed at which they are delivering results.</p>

    <h2>Creating teams that work</h2>
    <p>The success or failure of a startup is ultimately dependent on people, and how effectively they work together. This starts with clear roles, good communication and fostering the right culture. We want startups to benefit from the best examples of coaching, training and people management from successful blue chip organisations - and in this way, their personal development can keep pace with the growth and success of their business.</p>
