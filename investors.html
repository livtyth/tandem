      <h3>Predictable Project Management</h3>
      <p>&mdash;</p>
      <p>Getting stuff done isn’t rocket science, but it can be hard to create focus in a startup environment.We believe that startups need freedom to be creative, but we also know that taking a structured approach to project management like building a product roadmap, and taking a sprint led approach enables teams to deliver more, and it doesn’t have to be a trade off.</p>

      <h3>Trustworthy Management Information</h3>
      <p>&mdash;</p>
      <p>Your investment is about more than money - but your advice is only as good as the information it’s based on. We set up business management systems - such as accounting and CRM systems - appropriate to the size and complexity of the business. We work with your team to design simple processes to ensure everything is kept up to date and you get fewer nasty surprises.</p>

      <h3>Teams that work</h3>
      <p>&mdash;</p>
      <p>The success or failure of a startup ultimately depends on the people, and how effectively they work together. This starts with clear roles, good communication and fostering the right culture. We want startups to benefit from the best examples of coaching, training and people management from successful blue chip organisations - and in this way, their personal development can keep pace with the growth and success of their business.</p>
