            <p>Getting stuff done isn’t rocket science, but it can be hard to create focus in a startup environment. We believe that startups need freedom to be creative, but we also know that taking a structured approach to project management like building a product roadmap, and taking a sprint led approach enables teams to deliver more. It doesn’t have to be a trade off.</p>

            <p>Your investment is about more than money - but your advice is only as good as the information it’s based on. We set up critical systems - such as accounting and CRM systems - appropriate to the size and complexity of the business. We work with your team to design simple processes to ensure everything is kept up to date and you get fewer nasty surprises.</p>

            <p>The success of a startup ultimately depends on the people. This starts with clear roles, good communication and the right culture. We want startups to benefit from the best examples of coaching, training &amp; people management. Their personal development can keep pace with the growth and success of their business.</p>
