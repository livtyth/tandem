    <h2>Fundamentally right</h2>
    <p>We start with the essentials, like setting up a decent accounting package (such as Xero) and a cashflow forecast so you have a clear picture of your financial position. We can even take care of payroll and expenses.</p>

    <h2>Management Information</h2>
    <p>You (and your investors) need accurate information about the health of your business. We work with you to create a board pack, and implement systems and processes that support a seamless preparation each month.
    </p>

    <h2>More Insight. Less Data.</h2>
    <p>Starting from your strategy, we help identify the information that matters to you and find a practical way of tracking it - from bespoke dashboards in Google Analytics to pulling data from your database.</p>

    <h2>People Focus</h2>
    <p>We help you and your team deliver more by taking a structured approach, like defining a product roadmap and training your team to work together effectively. We do this by taking best practice from more established organisations (and leaving the bad stuff).</p>
